## Course Description

This course introduces students to requirements elicitation, analysis, and design activites of a use-case driven and architecture-centric software development process. The course discusses in detail the basic concepts, and methodology to capture requirements and hot wo map these requirements into design elements. 

Topics will include software development processes, Iterative and Agile processes, Unified Process, UML, requirements elicitation and specification, developing conceptual models of the problem domain of a software product, building design models, and using the obect-oriented methodology for building modular, reusable, and extensible software artifacts.
