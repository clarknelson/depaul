# Introduction to Software Engineering

* What is a Software Engineer?
* What is Software Engineering?
* What is Software Project Management?

** Software Quality**

1. Quality of Product
2. Quality of Process

** The four ps **

1. People
2. Process
3. Product
4. Projcet

Before the builder can start the development of a house, the blueprints must be approved and ready to use. Do we have an equivalent of blueprints in software engineering?

Ideally, software development is linear.

1. Requirements
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation

In the real world, software development is totally different. We make mistakes, the client's requirements change while the software is being developed.

In 1967, a NATO study group coined the term *software engineering* to catch up with traditional engineering disciplines. The goal was to avoid a software crisis of late, buggy, and over budget software projects.

A study of 9236 software projects in 2004 revealed the following:

1. 18% of software projects are canceled.
2. 53% of software projects are late, over budget, or missing features.
3. 29% of software projects are completed successfuly.

Before a new software development practice can be adopted, you must consider the cost of introducing an unfamiliar methodology. (training, maintence)

Clasical Waterfall Project Life-Cycle Model

1. Requirements phase
2. Analysis (specification) phase
3. Design phase
4. Implementation phase
5. Postdelievery maintence
6. Retirement

### Requirements Phase

* Explore the concept
* Elicit the client's requirements

### Analysis (specification) phase

* Analyze the client's requirments
* Draw up the specification document
* Draw up the software project managemnet plan
* "What is the product supposed to do?"

### Design phase

* Architectural design
* Detailed design
* "How the product does it"

### Implementation phase

* Coding
* Unit testing
* Integration
* Acceptance testing

### Postdelivery maintenance

* Corrective maintenance
* Perfective maintenance
* Adoptive maintenance

### Retirement

** Maintenance: ** The process that occurs when a software artifact is modified becuase of a problem or because of a need for improvement or adaptation.

Bad software is discarded, good software is maintained. Software, like reality, is constantly changing.

More time is spent on the maintence of software than the initial development.

Between 60% to 70% of all faults in large-scale products are requirements, analysis, and design faults.

** Documentation must always be current **

* Key individuals may leave before the documentation is complete.
* We cannot perform a phase without having hte documentation of the previous phase.
* We cannot test without documentation.
* We cannot maintain without documentation.

A software product contains: Programs, documents, configuration data, etc. 

Example software applications includes

* System software
* Application software
* Engineering/scientific software
* Embedded software
* Product-line software
* Web Applications
* AI Software

### Legacy software

Software must be **adapted** to meet the needs of new computing evironments or technology.

Software must be enhanced to implement new buiness requiremenets.

Software must be exteneded to make it interoperable with other more modern systems or database.

Software must be re-architected to make it viable within a network environment.

## Process Framework

The framework activies are preformed for every project, but the ubrella activities vary per project.

### Framework activites

* Communication
* Planning
* Modeling (requirements and design)
* Construction (writing code and tests)
* Deployment

### Umbrella Activites

* Software project management
* Formal technical reviews
* Software quality assurance
* Software configuration management
* Work product preparation and production
* Reusability management
* Measurement
* Risk management

## Development models

See the lecture pdf for examples of each process.

* The Waterfall Model (54)
* The Incremental Model (55)
* Evolutionary Models: Prototyping (56)
* Evolutionary Models: The Spiral (57)
* Unified Process (58)

The Unififed Process is similar to Agile Development and uses UML diagrams. 

### What is Agile Development

* Effective (rapid and adaptive) reponse to change
* Effective communication among all stakeholders
* Drawing the customer onto the team
* Organizing a team so that it is in control of the work performed

Agile development provides rapid, incremental delivery of software.

Extreme Programming (XP) is a popular Agile Process by Kent Beck.

* Begins with the creation of "user stories"
* Agile team assesses each story and assigns a **cost**
* Stories are grouped for a deliverable increment
* A commitment is made of delivery date
* After the first increment "project velocity" is used to help define subsequent delivery dates for other increments
